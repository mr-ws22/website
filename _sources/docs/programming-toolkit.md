# Programming toolkit

This section contains an overview about the programming toolkit you will need for our course. 

You will simply need to:

1. Install [Anaconda](anaconda) (includes Python and some toolkits)
2. Install [Visual Studio Code](vscode) (a code editor)

Please read the following instructions about Anaconda and Visual Studio Code.

## Anaconda

### Basics

The open-source [Anaconda Individual Edition](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) is one of the easiest ways to get started with data science projects. It already includes Python and the most important data science modules. 

:::{note}
Anaconda is a data science toolkit which already includes most of the data science modules we need.
:::


### Installation

You can skip this step if you already have Anaconda on your machine. If not, install the latest version of the Anaconda Individual Edition:

```{admonition} To do
:class: tip

- [Anaconda installation](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

```

Follow the steps described in the next section.

### Set up environment

Let's update Anaconda:

```bash
conda update --all
```

Now you can install the modules we need for our course in a new environment (we call this new environment `mr`). 

Copy this code and run it in your terminal: 

```bash
conda create -n mr python=3.9 pandas openpyxl jupyter scikit-learn altair vega_datasets matplotlib seaborn
```

When conda asks you: 

`Proceed ([y]/n)?` 

simply type `y` and press enter.

Now activate the new environment:

```bash
conda activate mr
```

## Visual Studio Code 

### Basics

Visual Studio Code (also called Code) is a powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with a rich ecosystem of extensions for Python.

:::{note}
Visual Studio Code is a code editor that can be used with a variety of programming languages including Python.

### Installation

Install VS Code:

:class: tip
- [Install Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
```

### Install extensions

The features that Visual Studio Code includes out-of-the-box are just the start. VS Code extensions let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your development workflow.

Let's install some important extensions:

:class: tip

- [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
- [Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) 
```

### Jupyter Notebooks

We usually work with Jupyter Notebook files in VS Code:

### Optional tutorials

Here some resources to get familiar with VS Code:

- Pro tips: [25 VS Code Productivity Tips and Speed Hacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifTF3ags0XI)


## Troubleshooting

Make sure that you use the latest version (in our course, we use Python 3.9). In your terminal, type `python --version` to see which Python version you are using in your Anaconda base environment.

*You may also uninstall your current Anaconda environment from your machine and install the latest version: here a guide of how to [uninstall Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/uninstall/).*

## Fundamentals

### Python

Python is an object-oriented language (an object is an entity that contains data along with associated metadata and/or functionality).

One thing that distinguishes Python from many other programming languages is that it is interpreted rather than compiled. This means that it is executed line by line which is particular useful for data analysis, as well as the creation of interactive, executable documents like Jupyter Notebooks.

:::{Note}
Python is an interpreted language. The Python interpreter runs a program by executing one statement at a time.
:::

On top of this, there is a broad ecosystem of third-party tools and modules (like Jupyter Notebook) that offer more specialized data science functionality.

---

### Jupyter Notebook

[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is an open-source application that allows you to create and share documents that contain code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. 

<br>

```{image} ../_static/img/jupyter.png
:alt: jupyter
:class: bg-primary mb-1
:width: 300px
:align: center
```

<br>

A notebook is basically a list of cells and the cells contain either

1. explanatory text (written in markdown)
1. executable code
1. code output

Note that we will use Jupyter Notebook inside the coding editor Visual Studio Code or Google Colab.

(colab)=
### Colab

Colaboratory, or “Colab” for short, is a free to use product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to perform data analysis and machine learning.

:::{note}
Colab is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup, and runs entirely on the Cloud.
:::

Watch this video to get a first impression of Colab:

Let`s start your first Colab notebook to get an overview about some basic features:

### Markdown

Markdown is one of the world’s most popular markup languages used in data science. Jupyter Notebooks use Markdown to provide an unified authoring framework for data science, combining code, its results, and commentary in Markdown. 

:::{note}
Markdown is a simple way to format text that looks great on any device.
:::

 Markdown files are designed to be used in three ways:

1. For communicating to decision makers, who want to focus on the conclusions, not the code behind the analysis.

2. For collaborating with other data scientists, who are interested in both your conclusions, and how you reached them (i.e. the code).

3. As an environment in which to do data science, as a modern day lab notebook where you can capture not only what you did, but also what you were thinking.
