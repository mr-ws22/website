## Course topics

Gain experience in data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and statistical inference while working on problems and case studies inspired by and based on real-world questions. 

The course will focus on the Python programming language.

## Learning objectives

By the end of the semester, you will be able to...

-   obtain, explore, visualize, and analyze data in Python to investigate patterns.
-   fit and evaluate linear and logistic regression models to make predictions.
-   perform simulation-based inference using randomization and bootstrapping.
-   use traditional statistical methods to test hypothesis.


## Where to get help

- If you have a question during lecture, feel free to ask it! 
- Outside of class, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on the Moodle course forum.
- Emails should be reserved for questions not appropriate for the public forum. **If you email me, please include the name of our course in the subject line.** 

Check out the [Support](course-support.md) page for more resources.

## Textbook

Textbook for the course:

- [Introduction to Modern Statistics](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/) by Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel and Johanna Hardin


## Lectures

A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing.
Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each lecture.

You are expected to bring a laptop to each class so that you can take part in the in-class exercises.


## Assessment

Assessment for the course is comprised of two components: 

- Optional [application exercises](application-exercises) to obtain 10 bonus points for the exam
- Exam (90 minutes at the end of the semester. 60% market research and 40% statistics)


(application-exercises)=
### Application exercises

Parts of some lectures will be dedicated to working on "Application Exercises" (AE). These small exercises will give you an opportunity to practice apply the concepts and code introduced in the readings and lectures. 

AEs should be completed and **submitted individually**.

:::{Note}
AEs are usually due within three days after lecture
:::

The AEs are due within **three days** after the corresponding lecture. For example, AEs from a Tuesday lecture would be due Friday by 11:59 pm ET.

Because these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on completion. Successful on-time completion of at least 80% of every AE will result in full credit (+10 bouns points in exam).

### Exam

There will be one exam at the end of the semester. Through the exam you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you've learned in the course.

The exam will focus on the conceptual understanding of the content but will also cover programming topics.  

More detail about the exams will be given during the semester.

## Grading

The final grade will be determined based on the following thresholds:

|  Grade       | Final Course Grade |
|--------------|--------------------|
| 1.0           | 96 - 100          |
| 1.3           | 91 - 95           |
| 1.7           | 85 - 90           |
| 2.0           | 80 - 84           |
| 2.3           | 75 - 79           |
| 2.7           | 70 - 74           |
| 3.0           | 65 - 69           |
| 3.3           | 60 - 64           |
| 3.7           | 55 - 59           |
| 4.0            | 50 - 54          |
| 4.7           | 15 - 49           |
| 5.0            | 0 - 14           |


## Tips for success

Your success on this course depends very much on you and the effort you put into it:

1.  Complete all the preparation work before class.
1.  Do the readings.
1.  Do the application exercises. The earlier you start, the better. 
1.  Don't procrastinate. If something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, and eventually you won't know where to begin asking questions. Don't let the week end with unanswered questions.
