# Programming toolkit

This section contains an overview about the programming toolkit you will need for our course. 

You will need to install:

1. the latest version of [Anaconda](anaconda) (includes Python and some toolkits) 
2. [Visual Studio Code](vscode) (a code editor)


Please read the following instructions.

(anaconda)=
## Anaconda

The open-source [Anaconda Individual Edition](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) is one of the easiest ways to get started with data science projects. It already includes Python and the most important data science modules.

### Uninstall your old version

To avoid compatibility problems with old versions of Anaconda, I recommend to uninstall Anaconda and install the latest version.

#### Windows

1. Open the file explorer.
1. Delete your environment (anaconda3\envs) and package (anaconda3\pkgs) folders in your user folder.
1. Open Add or remove programs and uninstall your Anaconda installation.

#### macOS

1. [Open your terminal](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac) 
1. Remove your entire Anaconda directory with `rm -rf`. Depending on your installation, your anaconda3 directory will be in your root folder or in your opt folder. If you are not sure where anaconda is installed, simply enter all commands. Note that there will be no information printed in the terminal - it will just remove Anaconda. 

First try the opt folder:

```bash
rm -rf ~/opt/anaconda3
```
Then this location:

```bash
rm -rf anaconda3
```

Finally, enter:

```bash
rm -rf ~/anaconda3
```

Close the terminal and proceed with the next step.

### Installation

Install the latest version of the Anaconda Individual Edition:

- [ðŸ’¾ Anaconda installation](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

```


### Use conda-forge

Instead of the conda default package manager, we want to use the community-led alternative `conda-forge` to install Python modules. 


- On *Windows* open the Start menu and open the "Anaconda Command Prompt". 

- On *macOS*: [Open a terminal](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac) 



Type this in your terminal to add `conda-forge`:

```bash
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```

Then make `conda-forge` the priority channel: 

```bash
conda config --set channel_priority strict
```


### Create a new environment


Now you can install some modules in a new Anaconda environment. We call this new environment `mr`. 

Copy this code and run it in your terminal: 


```bash
conda create -n mr python=3.9 pandas openpyxl jupyter scikit-learn altair vega_datasets matplotlib seaborn --y
```

Depending on your machine, the installation process may take a few minutes.

(vscode)=
## Visual Studio Code 


Visual Studio Code (also called Code) is a powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with a rich ecosystem of extensions for Python.

:::{note}
Visual Studio Code is a code editor that can be used with a variety of programming languages including Python.

### Installation

Install VS Code:

```{admonition} To do
:class: tip
- ðŸ’¾ Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
```

### Install extensions

The features that Visual Studio Code includes out-of-the-box are just the start. VS Code extensions let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your development workflow.

Let's install some extensions:


```{admonition} To do
:class: tip
- ðŸ’¾ Install [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)


- ðŸ’¾ Install [Live Share Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack)

```

Now close and restart VS Code.

### Jupyter Notebook extension

We usually work with Jupyter Notebook files in VS Code. 

```{admonition} To do
:class: tip
- ðŸ’¾ Install [Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) 
```
Now close and restart VS Code.

Open a Juptyer Notebook in VS Code:

```{admonition} To do
:class: tip
- Learn how to [use Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks)
```

If you can't select a kernel (like the Anaconda `base` kernel), try to close and restart VS Code once again.
